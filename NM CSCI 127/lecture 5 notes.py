#use float when number is decimal or after math has been done
#type function returns the type of variable whether its a string or int or float
#when a phrase is in quotes its a string
#int changes a number thats in charaters into an integer
#// does division where remainder doesnt matter
#binary numbers are in order from back to front where every number is 2 to
# a power that increases by 1 with each following number if number is 1 that
#number counts and if the number is 0 it doesnt count
#The digital logic design discussed above allows two voltage levels or states:
#false ≡ off ≡ 0
#and true ≡ on ≡ 1, translating naturally into binary numbers.
