            mystery = print(v) from first line of function v = verse
            verse giving a meaning earlier
            c = count("jam")
            return  c = 2
w = engima(v, c) v is verse which is "jam tomorrow and jam yesterday," and c is 2
    print ("but never", v [-1] last thing in that string is comma (,)
           for i in range c c = 2 i = 0,1,
           print jam 2 times
           w = enigma which returns day and c is 2 so print (c,w) prints 2 day
           
           putting mystery(verse) then mystery(v) makes v = verse

#When you define a function and have variables in perenthesis after it those
#variables are set equal to whatever you have in perenthesis after you recall
#the variables later ex. if you def lunch(x,y) then later you recall lunch
#with lunch(w,z) then x = w and y = z
